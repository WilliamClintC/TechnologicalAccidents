Spillover effects from technological accidents

My proposal would be to study the financial spillover effects of technological accidents. Much work has been done on
the spillover effects from natural disasters. This research proposal focuses on the “man made” aspects of disasters
(technological accidents), like industrial and transportation accidents. This would be important to policy makers in
quantifying how investment is affected by the characteristics of a technological disaster. Would technological accidents
increase investment and address future accidents or decrease investment as a sign of no confidence. What characteristics
of an accident would have a significant effect on a country’s economy. This would allow policy makers to better assess
economic damages that arise from such disasters and allocate resources for accident prevention.

Using data from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters - CRED, we gain access to a list of
technological disasters with information on accident types, location and fatalities. Furthermore interest rates, exchange
rates and central bank holdings are public information. From this we can see how interest rates, central bank holdings,
exchange rates change given a technological accident. Furthermore, knowing central banks hold foreign assets as a form
of diversification. We may investigate the effect of a foreign technological accident on a local central bank’s
diversification. From this we expect to find heterogeneity between developed countries against developing countries. We
also expect the effect to weaken across time. Lastly, we can identify and classify specific characteristics of disasters, by
type and scale, that would have a long lasting effect on a country’s economy.
